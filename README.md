# Arduino Uno Chess Clock

The first version of my code (code.ino) is made for a chess clock with the following design:

The second version of my code (revised_code.ino) is made for a different chess clock with the following design:

This chess clock allows you to set separate times for players 1 and 2 (although you can leave the times for player 2 blank if you want to have players 1 and 2 the same). 
Use the player 1 button to decrement, the player 2 button to increment, and the Set button to set that time setting. You can also set the increment time (in seconds) 
after setting player 1 and player 2's time. When the game is running, the Player 1 and Player 2 buttons will swap turns from black to white and vice versa, and the Set
button will pause and unpause the game. There's also a Reset button (not coded, but included in both designs) that will reset the chess clock back from the start. This
chess clock also can store the previous game setting and will restore those settings the next time you play. 

TLDR:
